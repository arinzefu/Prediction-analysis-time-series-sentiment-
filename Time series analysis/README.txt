I used pycharm for this work and the dataset was gotten from kaggle, it is a cinema ticket dataset and I deleted a few columns that were unnecessary, I used XGBoost, train_test_split and Grid Search CV. The second graph didnt show lines due to an error but it doesnt matter cause the information is the same as the first and 3rd graph but i wanted to just use different styles. 
I achieved a 93% accuracy and used it to predict the total sales for the next 3 months but I could only get the total sales per date in a tabular form, I didnt know how to plot the graph to show that run into different errors.
