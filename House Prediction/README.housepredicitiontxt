I used pycharm for this work and the dataset was gotten from kaggle, it is not a real dataset of Paris housing.
My code where i used linear regression was inspired my a course on udemy and the dataset from the tutorial there is not the same here. i got an accuracy of 77% with Linear Regession and i decided to another method to improve the accuracy.
The second method i used is gradient boosting Reggression and I achieved a 99% accuracy with it
